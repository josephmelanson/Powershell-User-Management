# Powershell-User-Management
This is an assignment from my INET 3700 course on Powershell. This script displays a menu to a user, and prompts them to chose from options that allow them to:
· Add a new local user
· Delete an existing local user
· Add a local user to a local group
· Remove a local user from a local group
· Change a local user password

Actions performed using this script are written to the Windows event log, with different messages and error codes being written for specific successes and failures.
